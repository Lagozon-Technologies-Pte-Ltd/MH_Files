Scenario 1: RO Count by RO_DATE
Rule: Count(DISTINCT ROHDR.SV_RO_HDR_SK) based on RO_DATE
Test Questions:

"How many ROs were opened on 2024-07-15?"

"What is the total number of ROs created in June 2024?"

"Give me the monthly RO count for 2024 based on RO creation date."

Scenario 2: Bill Count by RO_BILL_DATE
Rule: Count(DISTINCT ROHDR.SV_RO_HDR_SK) based on RO_BILL_DATE
Test Questions:

"How many bills were generated on 2024-07-15?"

"Show me the weekly bill count for July 2024."

"What is the total number of bills issued in Q2 2024?"

Scenario 3: Net RO Count
Rule: RO Count (based on RO_DATE) − RO Canceled Count (based on RO_CANCL_DATE)
Test Questions:

"What is the net RO count for July 2024?"

"Give me the net RO count for each month in 2024."

"What is the net RO count for Q1 2024 by location?"

Scenario 4: Revenue
Rule: SUM(Revenue) based on BILL_DATE − SUM(Revenue) based on Bill_Cancel_date
(Revenue is likely calculated from PARTS_TOTL_AMNT + LABR_TOTL_AMNT in MH_RO_HDR_DETAILS.)
Test Questions:

"What is the total revenue for July 2024?"

"Show the monthly revenue for 2024 after deducting canceled bills."

"What was the net revenue for Q2 2024 for the SUV segment?"

SELECT ROUND(SUM(SAFE_CAST(`ROH`.`PARTS_TOTL_AMNT` AS FLOAT64) + SAFE_CAST(`ROH`.`LABR_TOTL_AMNT` AS FLOAT64)), 1) AS `TOTAL_REVENUE` 
FROM `MH_RO_HDR_DETAILS` AS `ROH` 
WHERE `ROH`.`RO_DATE` BETWEEN DATE '2024-07-01' AND DATE '2024-07-31';
